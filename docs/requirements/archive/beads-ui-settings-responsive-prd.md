## Context

The beads-ui kanban board and settings engine built in w49 serve their purpose
but impose several workflow friction points as usage scales. Settings are
global-only (`~/.beads/config.json`), which forces every project to share the
same board column layout. A data science project with "Exploration / Modeling /
Validation" stages and a web app with "Blocked / Ready / In Progress / In Review
/ QA / Closed" columns cannot coexist without manual JSON file swaps.

Today, column layout is defined in a single global JSON file. There is no UI for
managing settings, so every change requires opening `~/.beads/config.json` in a
text editor, knowing the exact schema, and restarting or waiting for file-watch
to pick up changes. The board's CSS grid uses a fixed `min-width: 380px` per
column, which means five columns on a standard 1920px (1080p) monitor produce a
horizontal scrollbar (5 columns at 380px + gaps + padding = ~2076px). There is
no way to temporarily hide columns to focus on a subset of the workflow.

The immediate motivation is reducing daily friction: eliminating horizontal
scroll for the default five-column layout, enabling per-project board
customization without file juggling, and providing a proper settings UI so JSON
editing is no longer required. These improvements build incrementally on the w49
settings engine and board infrastructure.

## Current State Analysis

### Codebase Landscape

- **Runtime**: Node.js >= 22, ESM modules throughout
- **Server**: Express 4.x HTTP + ws WebSocket library, push-based subscription
  model
- **Client**: lit-html templates, simple store-based state management
  (`createStore`)
- **Build**: esbuild (ESM, es2020 target) | **Test**: vitest (dual node/jsdom) |
  **Lint**: eslint + prettier
- **Key deps**: express, ws, lit-html, marked, dompurify, debug
- **Commands**: `npm test`, `npm run tsc`, `npm run lint`,
  `npm run prettier:check`

### Relevant Modules

| Config resolver  | `server/config.js`                 | Resolves port/host from CLI flags > env vars > settings > defaults via `getConfig()`                              |
| Board view       | `app/views/board.js` (~1041 lines) | Dynamic column kanban with drag-drop, keyboard nav, filters, closed-date filter                                   |
| WebSocket server | `server/ws.js` (~1383 lines)       | 25 message types including `get-settings`, `settings-changed` broadcast                                           |

| Bootstrap        | `app/main.js`                      | SPA shell, column validation, settings hot-reload, board subscription lifecycle                                   |
| Protocol         | `app/protocol.js`                  | Message type definitions and `MESSAGE_TYPES` array                                                                |
| List adapters    | `server/list-adapters.js`          | 8 subscription types mapping to `bd` CLI commands                                                                 |
| Styles           | `app/styles.css`                   | Board grid (lines 1231-1364), filter dropdowns (lines 923-988), CSS variable design system                        |
| New issue dialog | `app/views/new-issue-dialog.js`    | Reference pattern for forms: grid layout, native elements, aria-live errors                                       |
| Router           | `app/router.js`                    | Hash-based routing: `#/issues`, `#/epics`, `#/board`                                                              |

### Existing Patterns

- **View factory pattern**: All views use `createXxxView(options)` returning
  `{ load, clear }`. The board view factory accepts `BoardViewOptions` including
  a `columns` array. New views must follow this convention.
- **Subscription model**: Each board column maps to a WebSocket subscription
  backed by a `bd` CLI command. Subscription types are validated against
  `SUBSCRIPTION_TYPES` in `server/validators.js`. New columns must use existing
  subscription types.
- **Settings lifecycle**: Settings load at startup via `loadSettings()`, are
  watched with 500ms debounce, and changes broadcast via `settings-changed`
  WebSocket event. Client re-validates columns and rebuilds the board on change.
  All returned settings use `structuredClone()` for immutability.
- **Filter dropdown CSS**: `.filter-dropdown` component with `.is-open` toggle,
  `.filter-dropdown__trigger` button, `.filter-dropdown__menu` positioned
  absolutely, `.filter-dropdown__option` items with checkbox support. Already
  fully styled.
- **Dialog/form pattern**: `new-issue-dialog.js` demonstrates grid-based form
  layout, native `<form>`/`<input>`/`<select>`, submit with busy state,
  `aria-live` error region. New forms should follow this pattern.
- **Column validation**: Both server (`mergeDefaults()`) and client
  (`validateColumnDefs()`) validate columns identically: `id`, `label`,
  `subscription`, `drop_status` must be non-empty strings. Invalid columns are
  filtered out; if none valid, defaults apply.

### Integration Points

| Integration Point                       | Direction             | Impact                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `get-settings` WS message               | Client <- Server      | Must return effective (merged) settings, not just global                                   |
| `settings-changed` broadcast            | Server -> All clients | Must broadcast effective settings on either global or project file change                  |
| `ensureTabSubscriptions()` in `main.js` | Client internal       | Subscribes based on `board_columns` array; must handle visible vs hidden columns correctly |
| Workspace switching (`set-workspace`)   | Client -> Server      | Must trigger project settings reload and broadcast                                         |
| File watcher (`watchSettings`)          | Server internal       | Must watch both global and project config files                                            |
| Board `--board-columns` CSS variable    | Template -> CSS       | Must reflect visible column count for responsive grid                                      |

### External Research Insights

- **CSS Grid `minmax()` with custom properties**:
  `repeat(N, minmax(var(--min), 1fr))` is well-supported in modern browsers.
  However, CSS `clamp()` cannot reference the column count dynamically (it comes
  from a JS-set variable), so the minimum width must be calculated in JS and
  applied as a CSS variable.
- **ResizeObserver**: The recommended modern approach for responding to element
  size changes, replacing `window.resize` listeners. Supported in all target
  browsers (Node 22 implies modern browser targets).
- **HTML5 Drag and Drop for list reorder**: The board already implements
  drag-drop for cards between columns using the native DnD API. The same pattern
  (dragstart/dragover/drop with insertion point calculation) works for list
  reorder in the settings column editor.

## Decisions Made

| Decision                      | Choice                           | Rationale                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Per-project settings scope    | Board columns only               | Server config (port/host) and discovery (scan_roots/scan_depth) are inherently global - they configure the running server instance, not the viewed project        |
| Settings merge strategy       | Complete replacement             | When project provides `board.columns`, it fully replaces global columns (not merge/extend). Matches existing atomic array validation pattern in `mergeDefaults()` |
| Responsive column approach    | JS-calculated CSS variable       | CSS `clamp()` cannot reference the dynamic column count from `--board-columns`. JS computes `--board-col-min-width` and CSS uses `minmax()` for layout            |
| Card condensation             | Progressive thresholds           | < 260px: hide type badge, reduce padding. < 180px: title only. Priority badge persists until minimal mode (it is small and critical)                              |
| Settings UI location          | Dedicated `#/settings` route     | Full-page view provides room for tabbed editor with Global/Local tabs, column CRUD, and discovery settings                                                        |
| Settings UI navigation        | Gear icon in header-actions      | Settings is a system-level concern, not a content view. Keeps primary tab nav (Issues/Epics/Board) focused on content                                             |
| Column visibility persistence | localStorage per workspace       | `beads-ui.board-col-vis:<workspace_path>` key. Low-friction toggle without modifying settings files                                                               |
| Column management capability  | Full CRUD + drag reorder         | Complete replacement for JSON editing. Includes validation, subscription type picker, conditional params                                                          |
| Column visibility filter      | Toggle only (no reorder)         | Reordering is a settings concern; the board filter stays simple and fast                                                                                          |
| Settings save mechanism       | Server writes JSON file          | The `save-settings` WS message sends partial settings to server, which writes the file. Existing file watcher detects change and broadcasts                       |
| Project config file location  | `<workspace>/.beads/config.json` | Same filename as global config but in the project's `.beads/` directory. Consistent naming, clear layering                                                        |

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: JavaScript (ESM) with TypeScript type checking via JSDoc
  annotations
- **Runtime**: Node.js >= 22
- **Server**: Express 4.x + ws (WebSocket)
- **Client**: lit-html for templates, native HTML elements for forms
- **Build**: esbuild
- **Test**: vitest (node + jsdom environments)
- **Lint**: eslint + prettier
- **CSS**: Custom properties design system, BEM naming convention
- **New dependencies**: None required. All features use existing capabilities.

## Non-Goals

- **Per-project server settings**: Port and host configuration remain
  global-only. Per-project server config would require running multiple server
  instances, which is a different architecture.
- **Per-project discovery settings**: Discovery scan_roots and scan_depth remain
  global. Discovery runs once at server startup to find all workspaces;
  per-project overrides would be circular (you need to discover a project before
  reading its settings).
- **Column merging/extending**: Per-project overrides fully replace global
  columns rather than merging or extending. Merge semantics (what does "extend"
  mean for reordered columns?) add complexity for unclear benefit.
- **Settings sync/export**: No mechanism to export settings or sync across
  machines. The config files are plain JSON and can be managed with dotfiles if
  needed.
- **Real-time collaborative editing**: The settings UI does not handle
  concurrent editors. If two browser tabs edit settings simultaneously,
  last-write wins. This is acceptable for a single-user tool.
- **Theme/appearance settings**: No UI for theme or visual customization beyond
  column layout. The existing `prefers-color-scheme` automatic dark mode is
  sufficient.
- **Column reordering in the board filter**: The board's column visibility
  dropdown only toggles show/hide. Reordering columns requires the Settings UI,
  keeping the board filter simple.

## Phased Roadmap

### Phase 0: Per-Project Settings Infrastructure

**Depends on:** none

- [x] `loadProjectSettings(workspace_root)` function in `server/settings.js`
      that reads `<workspace>/.beads/config.json` and validates `board.columns`
      if present
- [x] `getEffectiveSettings(workspace_root)` function that merges global
      settings with project overrides (project `board.columns` replaces global
      when valid)
- [x] `watchProjectSettings(workspace_root, onChange)` function with same
      debounce pattern as `watchSettings()`, returning `{ close }` handle
- [x] Update `get-settings` handler in `server/ws.js` to return effective
      (merged) settings for the active workspace
- [x] New `get-project-settings` message type that returns raw project overrides
      (not merged), enabling the Settings UI to distinguish "inheriting" from
      "overriding"
- [x] New `save-settings` message type accepting
      `{ scope: 'global' | 'project', settings: Partial<SettingsObject> }`, with
      server-side validation and atomic file write
- [x] Wire project settings watcher in `server/index.js` with lifecycle
      management: close old watcher and open new one on workspace switch
- [x] Broadcast effective settings on either global or project config file
      change
- [x] Update `app/protocol.js` with new message types (`save-settings`,
      `get-project-settings`)
- [x] Tests for project settings loading, merging, watching, saving, and
      workspace switch lifecycle

#### Phase 0 Outcomes

**What Was Completed:** All 10 Phase 0 deliverables were implemented across 6
commits:

1. **Protocol layer** (`app/protocol.js`): Added `save-settings`,
   `get-project-settings`, and `save-settings-result` message types with 6 new
   tests.
2. **Settings engine** (`server/settings.js`): Added `loadProjectSettings()`,
   `getEffectiveSettings()`, `watchProjectSettings()`, and exported
   `validateColumnDef()`. 14 new tests covering loading, merging, and watching.
3. **WS handlers** (`server/ws.js`): Updated `get-settings` to return effective
   settings when a workspace is active. Added `get-project-settings` and
   `save-settings` handlers with scope validation and atomic file writes. 8 new
   tests in `server/ws.settings.test.js`.
4. **Server bootstrap** (`server/index.js`): Wired project settings watcher
   alongside global watcher. Both watchers broadcast effective (merged) settings
   on change. Watcher lifecycle managed on workspace switch.
5. **Client integration** (`app/main.js`): No client changes needed; the
   existing `settings-changed` handler and board rebuild logic already processes
   whatever columns the server sends. Added 2 integration tests confirming
   project-override and fallback behavior.
6. **PRD documentation**: This section.

**Deviations from Plan:**

- Added `save-settings-result` as a third message type (not in original spec) to
  provide explicit success/error responses to save operations.
- `validateColumnDef` was changed from a private function to an export in
  `server/settings.js` so the WS handler can reuse it for save validation.
- No changes to `app/main.js` were needed for client integration; the existing
  architecture already handled effective settings transparently.

**Key Patterns Established:**

- **Effective settings merge**: Project `board.columns` atomically replaces
  global columns when valid; all other settings pass through from global.
- **Atomic file writes**: Write to temp file then `fs.renameSync` for both
  global and project config saves.
- **File watcher pattern**: `fs.watch` on `.beads/` directory with 500ms
  debounce, JSON.stringify comparison to detect real changes, returns
  `{ close }` handle.
- **ESM test isolation**: `vi.resetModules()` + `freshImport()` pattern for
  modules with persistent state (e.g., `CURRENT_WORKSPACE` in ws.js).

### Phase 1: Responsive Kanban Columns

**Depends on:** none (parallel with Phase 0)

- [x] `computeColMinWidth(viewportWidth, columnCount, gapPx, paddingPx)` utility
      in `app/views/board.js` that returns adaptive minimum column width floored
      at 180px
- [x] Set `--board-col-min-width` CSS variable on `.board-root` element
      alongside existing `--board-columns`
- [x] Replace CSS grid rule `repeat(var(--board-columns, 4), 1fr)` with
      `repeat(var(--board-columns, 4), minmax(var(--board-col-min-width, 300px), 1fr))`
      in `app/styles.css`
- [x] Remove fixed `min-width: 380px` from `.board-column` CSS rule
- [x] Add `.board-card--condensed` CSS class: hides type badge, reduces card
      padding, smaller meta font size (applied when column width < 260px)
- [x] Add `.board-card--minimal` CSS class: title-only display, hides all meta
      (applied when column width < 180px)
- [x] Register `ResizeObserver` on board mount element with 100ms debounced
      recalculation of column min-width and card condensation classes
- [x] Post-render column width inspection via `getBoundingClientRect()` to
      toggle condensed/minimal classes on cards
- [x] Tests for `computeColMinWidth` calculation logic

#### Phase 1 Outcomes

**What Was Completed:**

- `computeColMinWidth()` pure function added to `app/views/board.js` with 7 unit
  tests covering standard, edge, and floor cases
- CSS grid updated from fixed `1fr` to
  `minmax(var(--board-col-min-width, 300px), 1fr)` in `app/styles.css`
- Removed `min-width: 380px` from `.board-column`, eliminating forced horizontal
  scroll on 5-column layouts
- Added `.board-card--condensed` and `.board-card--minimal` CSS classes with
  progressive degradation thresholds
- `ResizeObserver` integration with 100ms debounce, registered on `load()` and
  disconnected on `clear()`
- Post-render `updateCardCondensation()` called after every `doRender()` to
  toggle card classes based on actual column widths
- 5 integration tests verifying ResizeObserver lifecycle and card condensation
  class toggling via mock ResizeObserver

**Deviations from Plan:**

- No deviations. All deliverables implemented as specified.

**Key Patterns Established:**

- `computeColMinWidth` is a standalone exported function (not inside
  `createBoardView` closure) for testability and reuse by Phase 2's
  `--board-columns` recalculation
- Card condensation uses `Array.from(querySelectorAll())` pattern for TypeScript
  compatibility with `NodeListOf` iteration
- ResizeObserver mock in tests uses a class-based mock (not `vi.fn()`) because
  `new ResizeObserver()` requires a constructor

### Phase 2: Column Visibility Filter

**Depends on:** Phase 0 (effective settings flow for column definitions)

- [x] Add `column_visibility` state (`Record<string, boolean>`) to board view
      local state, defaulting all columns to visible
- [x] Column visibility dropdown in the board filter bar following existing
      `.filter-dropdown` pattern: trigger button labeled "Columns" with "N/M"
      count badge, checkbox menu per column
- [x] Filter `col_defs` by visibility before mapping to `columnTemplate()` in
      the board template function
- [x] Update `--board-columns` CSS variable to reflect visible column count
      (integrates with Phase 1 responsive grid)
- [x] Persist visibility state to localStorage keyed by workspace path
      (`beads-ui.board-col-vis:<workspace_path>`)
- [x] Load visibility state from localStorage on board view `load()`, with
      reconciliation: new columns default visible, removed columns pruned
- [x] Keep subscriptions active for hidden columns (visibility is a render-only
      concern, not a data concern)
- [x] Tests for visibility toggle, persistence, reconciliation with column
      changes

#### Phase 2 Outcomes

**What Was Completed**

- `column_visibility` state (`Record<string, boolean>`) added to board view
  closure
- "Columns N/M" filter dropdown in the board filter bar using existing
  `.filter-dropdown` CSS pattern
- `col_defs` filtering before render: hidden columns excluded from the grid
- `--board-columns` CSS variable updated to reflect visible column count
- localStorage persistence keyed by workspace path
  (`beads-ui.board-col-vis:<workspace_path>`)
- Reconciliation logic: new columns default visible, removed columns pruned from
  stored state
- Subscriptions remain active for hidden columns (render-only concern)
- 11 tests covering toggle, persistence, reconciliation, and dropdown UI in
  `board.visibility.test.js`

**Deviations from Plan**

- No CSS additions were needed; the existing `.filter-dropdown` pattern covered
  all styling requirements without modification
- `reconcileVisibility` and persistence functions are internal to the
  `createBoardView` closure rather than exported, since they are tested through
  the public board view API

**Key Patterns Established**

- localStorage key pattern for per-workspace board preferences:
  `beads-ui.board-col-vis:<workspace_path>`
- Reconciliation pattern for stored-vs-current state divergence (reusable for
  Phase 3 settings changes)
- Click-outside handler pattern added to board view (mirrors existing list view
  pattern)

### Phase 3: Settings UI

**Depends on:** Phase 0 (save-settings protocol and per-project infrastructure)

- [x] Add `'settings'` to `ViewName` type in `app/state.js` and extend
      `parseView()` in `app/router.js` to handle `#/settings`
- [x] Add settings gear icon button in header-actions area of `app/index.html`
      (alongside theme toggle)
- [x] Add `<section id="settings-root" class="route settings" hidden>` to the
      SPA shell in `app/main.js` with route visibility management
- [x] Create `app/views/settings.js` with
      `createSettingsView(mount_element, store, transport)` factory returning
      `{ load, clear }`
- [x] Tabbed layout with "Global" and "Local (project-name)" tabs using
      `role="tablist"` / `role="tab"` / `aria-selected` pattern
- [x] Global tab: column editor with sortable list (drag handles, edit/delete
      buttons per row, "Add Column" button)
- [x] Global tab: discovery settings editor (scan_roots list with add/remove,
      scan_depth number input)
- [x] Column add/edit form: id (text, kebab-case validated), label (text),
      subscription (select of 8 types from `SUBSCRIPTION_TYPES`), params
      (conditional on subscription type), drop_status (select:
      open/in_progress/in_review/closed)
- [x] Conditional params UI: show status text input for `status-issues`, issue
      ID input for `issue-detail`, hidden for all other subscription types
- [x] Auto-suggest drop_status based on selected subscription type (e.g.,
      `closed-issues` suggests "closed")
- [x] Drag-to-reorder columns using HTML5 DnD API (same pattern as board card
      drag in `board.js`)
- [x] Keyboard reorder: ArrowUp/Down on drag handle swaps position, with
      `aria-live` announcement of new position
- [x] Local tab: radio toggle "Inherit global columns" (default) / "Override
      with custom columns", with column editor shown only in override mode
- [x] Validation: ID uniqueness, required fields, subscription-specific param
      requirements, with `aria-live` error display
- [x] Dirty detection via `JSON.stringify` comparison of draft vs saved state
- [x] Save button dispatches `save-settings` via transport (scope based on
      active tab), Reset button reverts to server state
- [x] External change handling: silent update when form is clean, toast
      notification when form is dirty
- [x] Settings page CSS: form grid layout, column editor rows, drag handle
      styling, tab bar, all using CSS variables and BEM naming
- [x] Tests for settings view lifecycle, column CRUD operations, validation, and
      dirty state management

#### Phase 3 Outcomes

**What Was Completed**

- Settings route (`#/settings`) with gear icon navigation in header
- `createSettingsView()` factory following the established view factory pattern
- Tabbed layout (Global / Local) with ARIA roles for accessibility
- Column CRUD: sortable list with drag-reorder (HTML5 DnD), keyboard reorder
  (ArrowUp/Down), edit/delete buttons, add column form
- Column form with conditional params UI (status for `status-issues`, issue ID
  for `issue-detail`) and auto-suggest `drop_status` based on subscription type
- Discovery settings editor (scan_roots list management, scan_depth number
  input)
- Local tab with inherit/override radio toggle and full column editor in
  override mode
- Dirty detection via `JSON.stringify` comparison with visual indicator
  (asterisk)
- Save via `save-settings` WS message with scope-based payload, reset to server
  state
- External change handling: silent update when clean, toast notification when
  dirty
- Full CSS using BEM naming and CSS variables with 600px responsive breakpoint
- 27-test suite covering lifecycle, CRUD, validation, dirty state, save/reset,
  local tab modes, and external change handling

**Deviations from Plan**

- Column delete does not show a confirmation dialog (immediate removal). The
  Reset button provides undo capability before saving.
- Keyboard reorder does not include `aria-live` position announcements (the
  column list re-renders with correct positions; screen reader support can be
  enhanced in a follow-up).

**Key Patterns Established**

- Transport adapter pattern: `createSettingsView` accepts a `{ send, on }`
  transport interface, allowing the main bootstrap to bridge the raw WS client
  with a type-safe adapter.
- Dual-panel tabbed layout: Global/Local tabs share `columnListTemplate()` and
  `columnFormTemplate()` functions with a `readonly` flag for the inherit mode.
- Form state management: closure-scoped `editing_index`, `adding`, and
  `form_error` variables avoid React-style state management while keeping
  templates declarative via lit-html.

### Responsive Column Behavior

```
5 columns on 1920px (comfortable):

### Data Flow: Settings Merge

```
                    ~/.beads/config.json (global)
                              |
                    loadSettings() -> cached global
                              |
    <workspace>/.beads/config.json (project, optional)
                              |
                    loadProjectSettings(root) -> project columns or null
                              |
                    getEffectiveSettings(root)
                    = global + project board.columns override
                              |
              +---------------+---------------+
              |                               |
    get-settings response            settings-changed broadcast
    (client request)                 (file change detected)
              |                               |
    Client: validateColumnDefs() -> board_columns
              |
    createBoardView({ columns: board_columns })
```

### Data Flow: Settings Save

```
    Settings UI: user edits columns, clicks Save
              |
    transport('save-settings', {
      scope: 'global' | 'project',
      settings: { board: { columns: [...] } }
    })
              |
    Server: validate columns with validateColumnDef()
              |
    Server: atomic write to appropriate config.json
    (write to temp file, then rename)
              |
    File watcher detects change (500ms debounce)
              |
    broadcastSettingsChanged(effectiveSettings)
              |
    All clients receive settings-changed event
              |
    Board rebuilds with new columns
```

## Key Risks and Mitigations

| Risk                                                        | Impact                                                                | Mitigation                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Project config file conflicts with `.beads/` database files | Medium - could confuse beads CLI or corrupt data                      | Use `config.json` filename (already used globally). Beads database uses `.db` files and `metadata.json`, no overlap            |
| Atomic file write race condition                            | Low - two rapid saves could interleave                                | Use write-to-temp-then-rename pattern. File watcher debounce (500ms) coalesces rapid changes                                   |
| ResizeObserver performance overhead                         | Low - could cause layout thrash on rapid resize                       | Debounce recalculation to 100ms. Only toggle classes when threshold is actually crossed                                        |
| Card condensed mode readability                             | Medium - narrow columns may be unusable below certain widths          | Hard floor at 180px before scroll kicks in. Progressive degradation (full -> condensed -> minimal) gives clear visual feedback |
| Settings UI dirty state vs external changes                 | Medium - external file edit while form is dirty could cause confusion | Toast notification for external changes when dirty, silent update when clean. User must explicitly save or cancel              |
| Column visibility hides important data                      | Low - users may forget columns are hidden                             | "Columns N/M" badge in filter bar makes hidden columns visible. All columns shown by default                                   |

## Verification Plan

### Phase 0

- [ ] `npm test` passes with all new settings tests
- [ ] `npm run tsc` reports no type errors in modified settings modules
- [ ] Creating `<workspace>/.beads/config.json` with valid `board.columns`
      causes board to display project-specific columns
- [ ] Removing project config file causes board to fall back to global columns
- [ ] `save-settings` with `scope: 'global'` writes to `~/.beads/config.json`
      and triggers board update
- [ ] `save-settings` with `scope: 'project'` writes to
      `<workspace>/.beads/config.json` and triggers board update
- [ ] Switching workspaces loads the correct project settings (or global
      fallback)
- [ ] Invalid project columns are filtered out and global defaults apply

### Phase 1

- [x] Board displays 5 columns on 1920px viewport without horizontal scrollbar
- [x] Board displays 8 columns with condensed cards (type badge hidden, reduced
      padding)
- [x] Horizontal scroll only appears when columns would be narrower than 180px
- [x] Cards show full meta at comfortable widths (> 260px per column)
- [x] Resizing browser window triggers column width recalculation and card class
      toggling
- [x] `npm test` passes with column width calculation tests
- [x] `@media (max-width: 1100px)` single-column fallback still works correctly

### Phase 2

- [x] Column visibility dropdown appears in board filter bar with all columns
      checked by default
- [x] Unchecking a column removes it from the board grid immediately
- [x] `--board-columns` CSS variable updates to reflect visible count
      (responsive layout adapts)
- [x] Visibility state persists across page reloads via localStorage
- [x] Switching workspaces loads correct visibility state for that workspace
- [x] Adding a new column via settings makes it visible by default in the filter
- [x] Hidden columns still receive subscription updates (no data loss)

### Phase 3

- [x] Navigating to `#/settings` displays the settings page with Global and
      Local tabs
- [x] Global tab shows current columns in a sortable list and discovery settings
- [x] Adding a column via the form creates a new entry in the list with all
      required fields
- [x] Editing a column updates its properties in the list
- [x] Deleting a column removes it from the list
- [x] Drag-to-reorder changes column order in the list
- [x] Keyboard reorder (ArrowUp/Down on drag handle) works
- [x] Selecting `status-issues` subscription shows the status param input; other
      types hide it
- [x] Validation prevents duplicate IDs, empty required fields, and missing
      subscription-specific params
- [x] Save button writes settings via WebSocket and board updates in real-time
- [x] Reset button reverts to last saved state
- [x] Local tab shows inherit/override radio; override mode enables the column
      editor
- [x] Saving in override mode writes to project config file
- [x] Switching back to "inherit" and saving removes project board columns
      override
- [x] `npm test` passes with all settings UI tests
- [x] `npm run tsc` and `npm run lint` clean

| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Which settings sections are project-overridable?   | Board columns only         | Server and discovery are global by nature                 |
| How should per-project override merge with global? | Complete replacement       | Project columns fully replace global columns; no merging  |
| Where does the Settings UI live?                   | `#/settings` route         | Dedicated page, not a modal or panel                      |
| How does column visibility persist?                | localStorage per workspace | Not in settings files; ephemeral per-browser              |
| Should the board filter support reordering?        | No, visibility only        | Reorder belongs in Settings UI                            |
| What responsive approach for columns?              | JS-calculated CSS variable | CSS alone cannot reference dynamic column count           |
| Settings UI board preview?                         | Deferred                   | Nice to have but not blocking; board updates live on save |
| Bulk import/export of column JSON?                 | Deferred                   | Power user feature; could be added in a future PRD        |
