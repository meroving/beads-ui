# Beads Workflow Context

> **Context Recovery**: Run `bd prime` after compaction, clear, or new session
> Hooks auto-call this in Claude Code when .beads/ detected

## SESSION CLOSE PROTOCOL

**CRITICAL**: Before saying "done" or "complete", you MUST run this checklist:

```text
[ ] bd dolt pull && bd dolt push          (if Dolt remote configured; PULL FIRST so the push is never rejected non-fast-forward)
```

<!-- BEGIN PROJECT-LOCAL -->
<!-- Generated block. Do not edit here. Edit .beads/PRIME.local.md in this repo,
     then run ~/.claude/bin/render-prime.py --write. -->
**Git remote:** `https://github.com/AstroMined/beads-ui.git` (origin).
**Dolt remote:** `origin` -> `git+https://github.com/AstroMined/beads-ui.git`, verified configured. Bead history is stored as
the `refs/dolt/data` ref in that repository, out-of-band from the code branches.
<!-- END PROJECT-LOCAL -->
**Note:** Dolt auto-commit is enabled. All `bd` writes create Dolt commits automatically.

## Core Rules

- Track substantive work in beads (multi-session, multi-file code changes, dependencies, discovered work)
- Trivial and non-code changes do NOT need a bead: Beads CRUD itself, single-doc/PRD edits, planning/roadmap notes, formatting, config touch-ups
- When in doubt on substantive work, prefer bd - persistence you don't need beats lost context
- Session management: check `bd ready` for available work

## Issue Quality Requirements

### The Four Content Fields

Every issue has four structured fields. **Use all relevant fields, not just `--description`.**

| Field           | Flag            | Purpose                               | When to Use        |
| --------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Description** | `--description` | Files, checklist, overview            | Always             |
| **Design**      | `--design`      | Architecture, approach, code patterns | Complex tasks      |
| **Notes**       | `--notes`       | Progress, decisions, gotchas          | As you work        |
| **Acceptance**  | `--acceptance`  | Pass/fail criteria, test commands     | **ALL leaf tasks** |

### Field Size Budgets (authoring guidance)

Verbose beads break cross-machine sync. Every field rewrite copies the FULL old and new
values into the `events` audit table and creates a Dolt commit, so a 20KB notes field costs
~40KB of permanent history PER APPEND, in every clone, forever. In Aug 2026 this made
`bd dolt pull` take 30+ minutes and silently broke sync between machines (silo_atlassian:
~800 commits and 17MB of event payload in two days).

The figures below budget what you are about to WRITE. They are not limits the store
enforces. The only enforced ceiling is the column type: all four content fields are Dolt
`text`, so **65,535 bytes each**. (`information_schema` also reports a 16,383-character
maximum, but that is only 65,535/4, the utf8mb4 worst case, and nothing enforces it:
`silo_atlassian-i61.13` stores a 29,222-character notes field.) No write under the column
ceiling is rejected, so the reason to stay small is history amplification, which is why the
budget lives here and not in a schema.

| Field                                                          | Budget                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Any single field (`--description`, `--design`, `--acceptance`) | 5,000 chars                              |
| `--notes` total                                                | 5,000 chars                              |
| One `--append-notes` entry                                     | 1,000 chars                              |
| Close `--reason`                                               | 2,000 chars                              |
| Whole issue (all four fields combined)                         | 10,000 target, 15,000 where a hook flags |

- Notes are POINTERS, not a lab notebook: reference commits, file paths, PRD sections, and
  other beads. NEVER paste diffs, test output, file contents, stack traces, or transcripts
  into any bead field. Long-form evidence goes in a repo doc (or the PRD), linked from the
  bead.
- If an update would blow the budget, write the detail to a durable doc and append a
  one-line pointer instead.
- **The budget binds your NEXT write, never a row already written.** The session-sync hook
  flags non-closed issues over 15,000 at session start (`BEAD BLOAT`), counting BYTES: it
  sums SQL `length()`, which is byte length, not `char_length()`. Read a flag as "spend
  carefully from here", and **do not trim an already-oversized bead to clear it** - a trim
  is itself a field rewrite, so it copies the full old and new values into `events` and
  costs MORE permanent history than leaving the row alone.
- A bead that is already pure pointers and still over budget is correctly sized. Some work
  genuinely needs length (a per-site edit list, a decision record and its evidence); the
  defect is padding and pasted output, not size as such.

### Field Usage by Hierarchy Level

| Level                   | Description                     | Design               | Notes               | Acceptance       |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Feature**             | PRD scope, epic overview        | -                    | Pipeline metadata   | -                |
| **Epic**                | Phase scope, overview           | -                    | -                   | -                |
| **Task/Session**        | Session scope, overview         | Ordering rationale   | Dependencies        | -                |
| **Subtask/Component**   | Files, implementation checklist | Architecture pattern | -                   | Test commands    |
| **Sub-subtask/Concern** | Specific implementation         | Code patterns        | Gotchas, edge cases | Concern-specific |

**MANDATORY: ALL leaf tasks (tasks with no children) MUST include `--acceptance`** with criteria
specific to that task's scope. Subtasks get test commands; sub-subtasks get concern-specific criteria.

### Note Prefixes (Cross-Session Memory)

Notes are **memory for future sessions**. Always use structured prefixes:

| Prefix       | When to Use                       | Example                                                     |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CONTEXT:`   | Creating tasks, background        | `CONTEXT: Relates to Phase 1 auth work`                     |
| `DECISION:`  | Design choices with reasoning     | `DECISION: Used html-to-markdown - better tables`           |
| `DEVIATION:` | Intentional differences from spec | `DEVIATION: Skipped retry logic - not needed for sync`      |
| `OUTCOME:`   | Completion results, test status   | `OUTCOME: All 15 tests passing. Coverage: 87%. Mypy clean.` |
| `FINDING:`   | Investigation results             | `FINDING: Root cause is race condition in worker pool`      |

**When to add notes:**

1. **Creating tasks:** Add `CONTEXT:` about related work
2. **Implementing:** Add `DECISION:` for non-obvious choices, `DEVIATION:` for spec changes
3. **Completing:** Add `OUTCOME:` with verification results

### Self-Contained Descriptions

**Rule: A future session must understand the task using ONLY `bd show <id>`.**

**BAD** (shallow placeholder - forces re-reading specs every session):

```bash
bd create --title="Feature implementation" \
  --description="Library integration, multi-source scanning"
```

**GOOD** (self-contained - implementable from `bd show` alone):

```bash
bd create --title="Feature implementation" --type=task --parent=<epic-id> \
  --description="$(cat <<'EOF'
## Files
- `src/project/feature.py`
- `tests/unit/test_feature.py`

## Implementation
- [ ] Feature class following BaseAdapter[Config] pattern
- [ ] Library integration
- [ ] Multi-source scanning from config
- [ ] Metadata extraction

## Tests
- [ ] Use real test data (no mocks)
EOF
)" \
  --design="Architecture follows BaseAdapter[Config] generic pattern." \
  --acceptance="$(cat <<'EOF'
- [ ] `uv run pytest tests/unit/test_feature.py` passes
- [ ] `uv run mypy src/project/feature.py` passes
EOF
)"
```

### Complete Four-Field Example

```bash
bd create --title="GitAdapter implementation" --type=task --parent=<epic-id> \
  --description="$(cat <<'EOF'
## Files
- `src/project/sources/git.py`
- `tests/unit/sources/test_git.py`

## Implementation
- [ ] GitAdapter class following SourceAdapter[GitConfig] pattern
- [ ] GitPython integration
- [ ] Multi-repo scanning
EOF
)" \
  --design="$(cat <<'EOF'
## Architecture
Follows `SourceAdapter[GitConfig]` generic pattern.

## Entry Point
[project.entry-points."project.sources"]
git = "project.sources.git:GitAdapter"
EOF
)" \
  --notes="CONTEXT: Use committed_date (unix timestamp), NOT authored_date" \
  --acceptance="$(cat <<'EOF'
- [ ] `uv run pytest tests/unit/sources/test_git.py` passes
- [ ] `uv run mypy src/project/sources/git.py` passes
EOF
)"
```

### Sub-subtask Example (Concern-Level)

Sub-subtasks capture a single implementation concern with code patterns and gotchas:

```bash
bd create --title="Timestamp handling" --parent=<subtask-id> \
  --description="Convert commit timestamps to timezone-aware UTC" \
  --design="$(cat <<'EOF'
from datetime import datetime, timezone

created_dt = datetime.fromtimestamp(
    commit.committed_date,
    tz=timezone.utc
)
EOF
)" \
  --notes="CONTEXT: commit.committed_date is Unix epoch (int). Always attach timezone."
```

### Rich Close Reasons

**Always close with `--reason` containing an OUTCOME.** Close reasons survive compaction
and provide context for future sessions. Rich means informative, not long: keep the whole
reason under 2,000 chars (see Field Size Budgets) - summarize verification, link details.

```bash
bd close <id> --reason="$(cat <<'EOF'
## OUTCOME
Successfully implemented feature X.

### Changes Made
1. Created src/project/feature.py with base pattern
2. Added tests in tests/unit/test_feature.py

### Verification
- All 12 tests passing
- Coverage: 87%
- Mypy clean, Ruff clean

### Notes
- DECISION: Used approach X because Y
- Deferred Z to future task <epic-id>.3
EOF
)"
```

**Closing patterns:**

```bash
# Successful completion (always include OUTCOME)
bd close <id> --reason="Completed: description. OUTCOME: Tests pass, coverage 85%."

# Won't fix / Deferred
bd close <id> --reason="Deferred: reason for deferral. Moving to <other-id>."

# Duplicate
bd close <id> --reason="Duplicate of <other-id>"

# Created in error
bd close <id> --reason="Created in error: explanation"
```

### Pre-Creation Checklist

Before running `bd create`, verify you have:

- [ ] **Title**: Clear, actionable summary
- [ ] **Description**: Files, implementation checklist, context (self-contained)
- [ ] **Acceptance** (leaf tasks): Testable pass/fail criteria
- [ ] **Design** (complex tasks): Architecture, approach, code patterns

## Essential Commands

### ID Format

Beads IDs are `<project>-<hash>` (e.g., `myproject-abc`). Children append `.N`
(e.g., `myproject-abc.1`). **Always use full IDs in `bd` commands.** Short suffixes
like `-abc` cause ambiguity errors when an epic has children, because `-abc` matches
the epic and all of its children simultaneously. Copy IDs directly from `bd ready`
or `bd list` output rather than abbreviating.

### Finding Work

- `bd ready` - Show issues ready to work (no blockers)
- `bd list --status=open` - All open issues
- `bd list --status=in_progress` - Your active work
- `bd show <id>` - Detailed issue view with dependencies

### Creating & Updating

- `bd create --title="..." --type=task|bug|feature --priority=2` - New issue
  - Priority: 0-4 or P0-P4 (0=critical, 2=medium, 4=backlog). NOT "high"/"medium"/"low"
- `bd update <id> --status=in_progress` - Claim work
- `bd update <id> --assignee=username` - Assign to someone
- `bd update <id> --title/--description/--notes/--design/--acceptance` - Update fields inline
- `bd close <id> --reason="OUTCOME: ..."` - Close with rich reason (**ALWAYS include --reason**)
- **Tip**: When creating multiple issues/tasks/epics, use parallel subagents for efficiency
- **WARNING**: Do NOT use `bd edit` - it opens $EDITOR (vim/nano) which blocks agents

### Dependencies & Blocking

- `bd dep add <issue> <depends-on>` - Add blocking dependency (issue waits for depends-on)
- `bd blocked` - Show all blocked issues
- `bd show <id>` - See what's blocking/blocked by this issue

### Persistence

Embedded Dolt with auto-commit enabled. Every `bd` write creates a Dolt commit
automatically. Data is durable immediately. For projects with a Dolt remote,
run `bd dolt pull` then `bd dolt push` to sync changes to other machines (pull
first so the push is never rejected non-fast-forward).

### Project Health

- `bd stats` - Project statistics (open/closed/blocked counts)

## Common Workflows

**Starting work:**

```bash
bd ready                                 # Find available work
bd show <id>                             # Review issue details
bd update <id> --status=in_progress      # Claim it
```

**Completing work:**

```bash
# Add OUTCOME note before closing
bd update <id> --append-notes="OUTCOME: All tests pass. Coverage 85%. Mypy clean."

# Close with rich reason
bd close <id> --reason="Implemented feature X with tests. OUTCOME: 12 tests passing, coverage 85%."
```

**Bug investigation (MANDATORY - create bug FIRST before any diagnostics):**

```bash
# 1. Create bug IMMEDIATELY (before investigation)
bd create --title="Bug: <description>" --type=bug --parent=<epic-id>

# 2. Claim it
bd update <new-id> --status=in_progress

# 3. NOW investigate (add findings as notes)
bd update <id> --append-notes="FINDING: Root cause is..."

# 4. Close when fixed
bd close <id> --reason="Fixed by <change>. OUTCOME: Tests pass."
```

**Creating an epic with child tasks (HIERARCHICAL):**

```bash
# 1. Create the parent epic
bd create --title="Epic name" --type=epic
# Returns: <epic-id>

# 2. Create child tasks using --parent flag
bd create --title="Task 1" --type=task --parent=<epic-id>
bd create --title="Task 2" --type=task --parent=<epic-id>
# Returns: <epic-id>.1, <epic-id>.2, etc.

# 3. View children of an epic
bd children <epic-id>
```

**Adding blocking dependencies (between siblings):**

```bash
# Task 2 cannot start until Task 1 completes
bd dep add <epic-id>.2 <epic-id>.1
```

## Parent-Child vs Dependencies

| Relationship            | How to Create                    | Effect                                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Parent-child**        | `--parent=<epic-id>` on create   | Hierarchical containment. IDs are `epic.1`, `epic.2`. Children appear in `bd children`. |
| **Blocking dependency** | `bd dep add <blocked> <blocker>` | Execution order. Blocked issue hidden from `bd ready` until blocker closes.             |

### Dependency Types

| Type              | Effect                                                          |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `blocks`          | Hard dependency - blocked task can't start until blocker closes |
| `related`         | Soft connection (informational only)                            |
| `parent-child`    | Hierarchical (auto-created with `--parent`)                     |
| `discovered-from` | Provenance - task found while working on another                |

### Critical Gotcha: Parent-Child is NOT Blocking

**`parent-child` is NOT a blocking relationship.** Children appear in `bd ready` even if
their parent is incomplete or blocked.

| Dependency Type | Effect on `bd ready`                                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `parent-child`  | Child tasks CAN be ready even if parent is incomplete   |
| `blocks`        | Blocked task won't appear in ready until blocker closes |

**Implication:** If you want "nothing in Session B can start until Session A completes":

- You must add `blocks` dependencies from Session A to EACH of B's subtasks
- Just blocking the parent Session B is NOT sufficient
- Children of a blocked parent are still ready to work on

```text
WRONG:  Session A blocks Session B
        └── But B.1, B.2, B.3 are still READY!

RIGHT:  Session A blocks B.1, B.2, B.3 individually
        └── Now none of B's children appear in `bd ready`
```

**Key distinctions:**

- Use `--parent` when tasks BELONG TO an epic (hierarchical structure)
- Use `bd dep add` when one task MUST COMPLETE BEFORE another can start (blocking)
- Do NOT use `bd dep add` to link tasks to their parent epic - use `--parent` when creating

## Reference

### Issue Types

| Type      | When to Use                                                    |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `feature` | PRD implementation container (parent of epics in the pipeline) |
| `epic`    | Large work container spanning multiple tasks                   |
| `task`    | Discrete deliverable with clear completion                     |
| `bug`     | Defect, unexpected behavior, investigation                     |
| `chore`   | Maintenance, cleanup, no user-facing change                    |

In the pipeline, the hierarchy is: **Feature -> Epic -> Task/Bug**. Feature beads
are created by `prepare-feature` and contain PRD path, feature branch, and parent
branch metadata in CONTEXT: notes.

### Priority Levels

| Priority | Meaning           |
| -------- | ----------------- |
| 0 (P0)   | Critical/blocking |
| 1 (P1)   | High priority     |
| 2 (P2)   | Normal (default)  |
| 3 (P3)   | Low priority      |
| 4 (P4)   | Backlog           |

Use numeric 0-4 or P0-P4 format. Do NOT use "high"/"medium"/"low".

### Status Values

| Status        | Meaning                                           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `open`        | Not started                                       |
| `in_progress` | Currently being worked on                         |
| `in_review`   | Implemented, awaiting code review or validation   |
| `blocked`     | Waiting on dependency                             |
| `closed`      | Completed                                         |

The `in_review` status is a custom status (setup: `bd config set status.custom "in_review"`).
It does NOT appear in `bd ready` output. Query it explicitly: `bd list --status=in_review`.

### Assignee Routing (Pipeline)

When working within the implementation pipeline, the `assignee` field acts as a
dispatch queue. Each skill checks for work assigned to it and routes completed
work to the next skill:

```text
prepare-feature -> sets assignee=prepare-epic on new epics
prepare-epic    -> sets assignee=implement-epic on completion
implement-epic  -> sets status=in_review, assignee=finalize-epic
finalize-epic   -> sets assignee=finalize-feature (pass) or implement-epic (fail)
finalize-feature -> closes beads (clean) or creates new epics (remediation)
```

Query patterns:
- `bd ready --assignee=prepare-epic` - epics awaiting preparation
- `bd ready --assignee=implement-epic` - epics ready for implementation
- `bd list --status=in_review --assignee=finalize-epic` - epics awaiting review
- `bd list --status=in_review --assignee=finalize-feature` - epics awaiting validation

### What Survives Compaction

When bd compacts old issues, it preserves: **Title, Description, Close reason, Notes**.
Write these fields as if explaining to someone with no conversation history.

---

## Best Practices

### DO

- Write self-contained descriptions (files, checklist, tests, acceptance)
- Use all four content fields appropriately (not just `--description`)
- Always provide `--reason` when closing (with OUTCOME)
- Update notes with prefixes as if explaining to a future agent with zero context
- Create a bead for substantive work: bugs, features, multi-file code changes, anything spanning sessions or carrying dependencies
- Create discovered issues immediately - don't lose context
- Check `bd ready` at session start and after closing tasks
- Use `--json` for machine-parseable output
- Use heredocs (`cat <<'EOF'`) for multi-line field content

### DON'T

- Don't over-track: Beads CRUD, simple doc/PRD edits, and planning notes do not need their own bead (and do not need a feature branch or PR)
- Don't forget to claim tasks with `in_progress` before starting
- Don't close without `--reason` - future sessions need context
- Don't create more than 4 levels (feature -> epic -> task -> subtask)
- Don't create shallow placeholder descriptions that just reference spec files
- Don't put everything in `--description` - use `--design`, `--notes`, `--acceptance`
- Don't modify issues that are closed/tombstoned (create new ones instead)

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No ready issues" but work exists

```bash
bd list --status=open --json   # Check if everything is blocked
bd dep tree <id>               # See what's blocking
```

### Need to re-parent an issue

```bash
bd update <id> --parent=<new-parent-id>
```

### Accidentally closed wrong issue

```bash
bd update <id> --status=open   # Reopen it
```
